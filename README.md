A simple CLI tool to manage self-hosted development VMs as drop-in replacements for Google Cloud Workstations.

**💰 Save 61-83% on cloud development costs**

## How It Works

This tool runs **entirely from your local machine** (Mac/Linux). No need to SSH into Cloud Workstations.

**Simple workflow:**
1. Install `vmws` CLI on your Mac
2. Configure once: `vmws config`
3. Create VM: `vmws create` or `vmws init-fresh`
4. Daily use: `vmws start` → `vmws tunnel` → code in browser
5. Save money: VM auto-stops after 2hr idle

**Under the hood:**
- Uses `gcloud` commands to manage VMs remotely
- Takes disk snapshots via Cloud API (no SSH needed)
- Creates VMs with IAP authentication (secure, no public IPs)
- Installs dev tools via startup scripts
- Monitors idle time and auto-shuts down

## Features

✅ **Same functionality as Cloud Workstations**
- Web-based VS Code (code-server)
- Docker, neovim, full dev environment
- IAP authentication & secure access
- Auto-shutdown after 2hr idle

✅ **Massive cost savings**
- Cloud Workstation: **$150/month**
- Self-managed VM: **$26-59/month**
- **Save $91-124/month (61-83%)**

✅ **Simple CLI interface**
```bash
vmws create   # Create VM from workstation
vmws start    # Start VM
vmws tunnel   # Connect to code-server
vmws stop     # Stop VM
```

## Two Ways to Use This

**Everything runs from your local machine (Mac/Linux) - no need to SSH into workstations!**

### Option 1: Migrate from Cloud Workstation
Copy your entire Cloud Workstation environment (all files, projects, dotfiles, configs) to a self-managed VM.

**Best for:** You already have a Cloud Workstation with your development setup.

### Option 2: Start Fresh
Create a brand new development VM with Docker, code-server, and neovim pre-installed.

**Best for:** Starting a new project or don't have an existing Cloud Workstation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install (on your local machine)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vm-workstation-manager.git
cd vm-workstation-manager

# Install CLI
./bin/vmws install

# Or manually
cp bin/vmws /usr/local/bin/vmws
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vmws
```

### 2a. Create VM - Migrate from Cloud Workstation

**Run everything from your Mac - no SSH into workstation needed!**

```bash
# Step 1: Find your Cloud Workstation's disk name
gcloud compute disks list --filter='name~workstations'
# Look for: workstations-XXXXX (in your workstation's region)

# Step 2: Configure vmws with the disk info
vmws config \
  --workstation-disk workstations-XXXXX \
  --region northamerica-northeast1 \
  --zone northamerica-northeast1-b \
  --vm-name my-dev-vm

# Step 3: Create the VM (runs remotely via gcloud)
vmws create
```

**What happens:**
1. Takes snapshot of your workstation disk (remotely via `gcloud`)
2. Creates new VM with fresh Debian 12 OS
3. Attaches your workstation data as `/mnt/home/user/`
4. Installs Docker, code-server, neovim
5. Sets up auto-shutdown (2hr idle)

**Time:** ~6 minutes

**What gets copied:** Everything from your workstation's `/home/user/`:
- ✅ All projects (code, data, documents)
- ✅ All dotfiles (.bashrc, .gitconfig, .ssh, .config, .vimrc, etc.)
- ✅ All application data (npm packages, cache, configs)
- ✅ Command history, SSH keys, cloud credentials

**What's installed fresh:**
- ❌ Operating system (new Debian 12)
- ❌ System packages (Docker, neovim binaries)
- ❌ code-server

### 2b. Create VM - Start Fresh (no workstation needed)

**Perfect for new projects or if you don't have a Cloud Workstation.**

```bash
# Configure your VM settings
vmws config \
  --vm-name my-dev-vm \
  --zone us-central1-a

# Create fresh VM
vmws init-fresh
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates brand new VM with fresh Debian 12
2. Creates empty 200GB data disk
3. Installs Docker, code-server, neovim
4. Sets up auto-shutdown (2hr idle)

**Time:** ~5 minutes

**What you get:**
- ✅ Fresh Debian 12 VM
- ✅ Docker, code-server, neovim installed
- ✅ Empty `/mnt/home/` directory for your projects
- ✅ Default shell configs (.bashrc, .profile)

**What you DON'T get:**
- ❌ No existing projects or files
- ❌ No custom dotfiles or configs
- ❌ No SSH keys (generate new ones)
- ❌ Clean slate

### 3. Daily Use (from your local machine)

**All commands run from your Mac/Linux terminal:**

```bash
# Start your VM (takes ~30 seconds)
vmws start

# Open tunnel to code-server (web-based VS Code)
vmws tunnel
# Then visit: http://localhost:8080 in your browser

# Or SSH into the VM
vmws ssh

# Check if VM is running
vmws status

# Stop VM when done (save money)
vmws stop

# View auto-shutdown logs
vmws logs
```

**Key point:** Your VM auto-stops after 2 hours of idle time, so you only pay for compute when actively using it!

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `vmws create` | Create VM from workstation (run from workstation) |
| `vmws init-fresh` | Create VM from scratch (no workstation needed) |
| `vmws start` | Start stopped VM |
| `vmws stop` | Stop VM to save money |
| `vmws status` | Show VM status |
| `vmws connect` / `vmws ssh` | SSH into VM |
| `vmws tunnel` | Start IAP tunnel to code-server |
| `vmws logs` | View auto-shutdown logs |

vmws config --vm-name my-dev-vm --zone us-central1-a --project my-project

# Config stored at: ~/.vmws/config
```

## Cost Breakdown

### Cloud Workstation
- **$150/month**
  - $6/month: e2-standard-2 VM
  - $144/month: Control plane (workstation cluster)

### Self-Managed VM (24/7)
- **$59/month**
  - $49/month: e2-standard-2 VM compute
  - $8/month: 200GB data disk
  - $2/month: 50GB boot disk
- **Savings: $91/month (61%)**

### Self-Managed VM (8hrs/day with auto-stop)
- **$26/month**
  - $16/month: Compute (8hrs × $0.067/hr × 30 days)
  - $10/month: Disks (always charged)
- **Savings: $124/month (83%)**

## Backup & Recovery

**Protect your work with incremental snapshots:**

```bash
# Create a backup (incremental, only changed blocks)
vmws backup

# List all backups
vmws snapshots

# Restore from a backup if something breaks
vmws restore dev-workstation-backup-20251125-140530
```

**Why snapshots?**
- **Incremental:** Only changed blocks are stored (~$0.026/GB/month)
- **Fast:** First snapshot copies all data, subsequent ones only changes
- **Safe:** Your insurance if VM breaks or you mess something up
- **Cheap:** Weekly backups cost pennies

**Recommended schedule:**
- Before major changes (new software, big config changes)
- Weekly automated backups
- Before OS upgrades

Your code should be in git, but snapshots protect your **entire environment** (dotfiles, configs, installed tools, data).

## Auto-Shutdown

Your VM automatically shuts down after **2 hours of idle time** (same as Cloud Workstations).

Tracks:
- SSH connections
- code-server connections

**Adjust timeout:**
```bash
vmws ssh
sudo vim /usr/local/bin/vm-auto-shutdown.sh
# Change IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=120
sudo systemctl restart vm-auto-shutdown
```

## Requirements

- Google Cloud account
- gcloud CLI installed
- Cloud Workstation (for initial VM creation)
- Compute Engine API enabled

## Troubleshooting

### VM won't start
```bash
vmws status
gcloud compute instances describe <vm-name> --zone=<zone>
```

### Can't connect to code-server
```bash
vmws ssh
sudo systemctl status code-server
sudo systemctl restart code-server
```

### Auto-shutdown not working
```bash
vmws logs
```

## Migration Guide

**From Cloud Workstation to self-managed VM:**

1. **Test the VM** (keep both running)
   ```bash
   # On workstation
   vmws create

   # On local machine
   vmws start
   vmws tunnel
   ```

2. **Validate** (use VM for a few days)
   - Test all your workflows
   - Verify tools work
   - Check performance

3. **Migrate** (when confident)
   - Stop using Cloud Workstation
   - Delete workstation cluster
   - **Save $91-124/month**

## FAQ

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes. Uses IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy) with same Google Cloud SSO as workstations. No public IPs exposed.

**Q: What if my VM shuts down?**
A: Just run `vmws start`. Takes ~30 seconds.

**Q: Can I use a different machine type?**
A: Yes. Edit `scripts/create-test-vm.sh` and change `MACHINE_TYPE`.

**Q: What about backups?**
A: Your data is on a persistent disk. Create snapshots regularly with `gcloud compute disks snapshot`.

**Q: Can I run multiple VMs?**
A: Yes. Use `vmws config --vm-name dev-vm-2` to manage different VMs.

Perfect for:
- ✅ Solo developers
- ✅ Small teams (2-5 people)
- ✅ Cost-conscious projects
- ✅ Learning GCP infrastructure

## Credits
